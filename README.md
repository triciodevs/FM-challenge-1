## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox





### What I learned

How to practically make the project responsive to all devices 

```css
////
    @media (max-width: 1313px) {

  .container {
    width: 100px;
    padding: 10px;
  }
}

/* for huge tablets */


@media (max-width: 1167px) {
  .container {
    width: 120px;
    padding: 5px;
  }
}


/* for tablets */


@media (max-width: 768px) {

  .container {
    width: 100px;
    padding: 10px;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}


/* for phones */

@media (max-width: 320px) {

  .container {
    width: 50px;
    padding: 20px;
  }
} 




### Continued development

I would like to improve generally in how I add depth to cards  or profile to make it look more professional without ignoring the proper use of semantic html



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_text/Wrapping_breaking_text) - This helped me in sizing the text width. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
